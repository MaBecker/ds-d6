## noanim version

There are two bootloader versions for DS-D6 found in the field.
One with moving arrows when doing the update and one with static image.
First it was not clear which one is newer/better but now it is clear the one with moving arrows is unstable,
so it is preferred to **get the one with no animation** to have stable DFU update procedure.
Looks like the animation is too heavy so sometimes the update breaks in the middle with timeout or cause some unexpected delays.
It is still possible to retry so you probably cannot brick your device with this booloader, it is just annoying.
