This is build of vanilla SDK12 based Espruino including its bootloader for best compatibility.
You get a bit more features thanks to SDK12 and SoftDevice S132 v3.1 like e.g secure connections.
You also get slightly less available RAM and flash memory.

Beware that you first need to flash fixed bootloader that can uprgrade to >=3.0 versions of SoftDevice.
Stock Desay bootloader with no fix will corrupt SoftDevice area and brick you device.
